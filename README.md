# 2023-2 ML Final Project
## Goal: To apply the loss of MCL to PARSE, which is not validated for validly grouping representations into the same class, and achieve better performance compared to PARSE.

â†’ PARSE (Pairwise Alignment of Representations in Semi-Supervised EEG learning for Emotion Recognition), a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) algorithm specialized in emotion recognition, has not been verified to be able to effectively group into the same class in actual classification. Therefore, we expect better performance by applying the loss of MCL (Multi-level Consistency learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation), which can effectively group into the same class in actual classification, to PARSE.
